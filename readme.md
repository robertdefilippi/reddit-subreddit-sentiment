# Sentiment Analysis of Posts in Subreddits

A flask app which looks at 50 of the top subreddits on Reddit, to determine if the 'hot' posts are either positive, negative, or neutral. E.g. Are we seeing more positive posts
in `WorldNews` than we are in `todayilearned`? Or are subreddits which use more images and/or gifs, being analyzed the same as those with more text posts?

The visualization is a histogram distribution of score for each post title from various subreddits 

Each post is given a sentiment score between -1 and 1. The closer the score is to 1 the more positive the post title is, the closer to -1 the more negative. 
A score of 0 is a neutral. The analysis of the post is done through the nltk package to determine the post title's sentiment.

> Ex.  
> 
> Title: `Square Roots of Living Beings`  
> Score: `0`  
> Type: `Neutral`  
> 
> Title: `The best present!`  
> Score: `0.6696`  
> Type: `Positive`  
>   
> Title: `Deaf child gets bullied constantly at this school ...`  
> Score: `-0.6858`  
> Type: `Negative`  

The histogram is generated by counting and binning each of the individual sentiment scores for various subreddits.
